<h2>About</h2>
<p>This bot automates several features within the messaging platform<a href="discord.com"> Discord </a>
using discord.js commando, a node.js module for interacting with Discord APIs. These features can be called
by users by typing a key phrase, such as "!pin" as seen above. This bot not only saves me (and other admins who use it) time, but makes the platform more accessible to people who are new to Discord. For example, admins won't have to manually assign roles to every new member in their server or tediously delete every spam message. Members can assign roles to themselves by clicking emojis, and admins can delete many messages at once.</p>
